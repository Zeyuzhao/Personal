description: a plan for my site
---

Today, I got my personal website working. This is a project I have long dragged on - in fact, I had been "working" on this website for over 4 years! I have finally settled on using GitHub's Github Pages along with Jekyll. I have used this platform in the past, such as building MBHS Dev Clubâ€™s website. I found this fantastic theme, Indigo (made by Kopplin), which I am using for my blog. I found this theme to be very clean and light, which I think are two important attributes for a personal blog.

I am planning to use this blog to showcase some of my research and technical projects. In some posts, I will try to elucidate a technical concept. In others, I may detail my experiences working on projects. I may also sneak in a few casual posts on life here and there.

I look forward to seeing my site grow, and I hope you will find something interesting here!
