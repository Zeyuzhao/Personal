# About Me

Welcome to my corner on the Internet! This is Zach Zhao, a senior in the [Magnet Program](https://mbhs.edu/departments/magnet/) at Montgomery Blair HS.

I solve problems at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Design and Data Visualization. Under the guidance of Prof. [John Dickerson](http://jpdickerson.com/), I have done research applying Geometric Deep Learning techniques to solve kidney exchange matchings. My project was accepted to the [AAAI-20 Conference](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-20/) and will be published in the Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. I am also a [2020 Regeneron Scholar](https://www.societyforscience.org/regeneron-sts/2020-scholars/) and [ACM/CSTA Cutler-Bell Prize Winner](https://csteachers.org/page/csta-acm-cutler-bell-prize).

I enjoy doing small projects involving electronics and web technologies. I experiment with components like the Raspberry Pi and Arduino. I have created gadgets ranging from a [tablet controlled robot](https://github.com/Zeyuzhao/RPiArduBot) to [WiFi localization](https://github.com/Zeyuzhao/Localization).

Outside of tech, I enjoy swimming, hiking and playing the violin. I have performed in the [All National Symphony Orchestra](https://nafme.org/2019-national-conference-and-all-national-honor-ensembles/2019-all-national-honor-ensembles/) and I am currently a violinist in the [Maryland Classic Youth Orchestra Philharmonic](https://mcyo.org/?page_id=11).

I am open for business inquiries, projects and research collaborations. If you are interested, feel free to contact me at thezachzhao@gmail.com.
